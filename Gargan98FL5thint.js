Time and time again they've voted to increase their salaries, increase the deficit, stay in office till the end of time, and to top it all of they've done this all while raising millions of dollars. Now, I ask you; where is that money coming from? Their own financial reports reveal it is NOT coming from average citizens. The vast majority of contributions are coming from big business and special interests. <br><br>Well there's one man who's sick and tired of these rascal politicians: Jack Gargan. While campaigning for Tampa city council, Gargan became enraged at the amount of money involved in US politics vowing to do something about it. Gargan started the T.H.R.O (Throw Hypocritical Rascals Out), thereby starting a chain of events leading to billionaire Ross Perot gaining 20%, and later 8%, in the 92 and 96 elections. <br><br>Now he's running for congress in Florida's 5th district, challenging incumbent rascal politician Karen Thurman. It will take a miracle to unseat the rascal politicians in Washington, after all they've got the money, the connections, they know how to work the people who really decide American politics. But Gargans got something better, he's got the Average American on his side.<br></div>","image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/9vyNBet.png","winning_electoral_vote_number":270,"advisor_url":"","recommended_reading":"<ul>\n<li><a href=https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/editorials/ct-edit-chicago-tribune-biden-endorsement-20200925-lnyxsb5qvrftnjjmj3rnzj33jy-story.html>Our Case For Joe Biden</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://nationalinterest.org/feature/case-trump-166808>The Case For Trump</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/935730100/how-biden-won-ramping-up-the-base-and-expanding-margins-in-the-suburbs>How Biden Won: Ramping Up The Base And Expanding Margins In The Suburbs</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/donald-trump-joe-biden-us-election-almost-win-votes-concede>Why Did Trump Almost Win?</a></li>\n<li><a href=https://www.hoover.org/research/no-evidence-voter-fraud-guide-statistical-claims-about-2020-election>No Evidence For Voter Fraud: A Guide To Statistical Claims About The 2020 Election</a></li>\n</ul>","has_visits":0,"no_electoral_majority_image":"../static/images/2012-no-majority.jpg"}}];e.temp_election_list = [{"id":20,"year":2016,"is_premium":0,"display_year":"1998 Florida 5th"}];e.credits = "Ohas";e.global_parameter_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.global_parameter","pk":1,"fields":{"vote_variable":1.125,"max_swing":0.12,"start_point":0.94,"candidate_issue_weight":10,"running_mate_issue_weight":3,"issue_stance_1_max":-0.71,"issue_stance_2_max":-0.3,"issue_stance_3_max":-0.125,"issue_stance_4_max":0.125,"issue_stance_5_max":0.3,"issue_stance_6_max":0.71,"global_variance":0.01,"state_variance":0.005,"question_count":25,"default_map_color_hex":"#C9C9C9","no_state_map_color_hex":"#999999"}}];e.candidate_json = [{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1001,"fields":{"first_name":"Jack","last_name":"Gargan","election":20,"party":"Reform","state":"Florida","priority":1,"description":"<div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'><div style='overflow-y:scroll;height:200px;'>Jack Gargan is sick and tired of politics as usual.
